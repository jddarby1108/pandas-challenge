Python and Pandas code to analyze gamer data

## Installation

This code is currently being used to get me an A on my homework :)

## Three observations
The gamers are mostly male 84%.
They are mostly 20-24 45%.
If they could appeal to the 35-39 year olds, they could increase their overall average Purchase price as they spend the most per purchase.
Final Critic is the most expensive and most purchased item.
